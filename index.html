  <h2>Definition and Purpose</h2>
  <p>Test notes, simply put, are notes taken with the intention of preparing for exams or assessments. Unlike regular notes, which may serve as a reference for understanding concepts, test notes are tailored specifically for aiding in revision and studying. They are condensed, concise, and focus on the most pertinent information that is likely to appear on exams.</p>

  <h2>Importance of Test Notes in Learning</h2>
  <p>The process of creating test notes serves as an active learning strategy. Instead of passively consuming information, students engage with the material by selecting, organizing, and summarizing key points. This not only aids in comprehension but also enhances retention. By condensing complex information into digestible chunks, test notes facilitate efficient studying and help students prioritize their review efforts.</p>
